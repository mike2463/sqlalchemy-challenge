In the resources folder is the sqlite file that I pulled the data from for both files. In the climate_starter file I do a basic analysis of the data and graph the precipation amounts and the temperatures of the most active station. In the app.py file I use the Flask library to use the same data to create APIs for the data. The first API reports the participation, the second shows the stations, the third shows the temperatures for the most active stations, and the last ones show the highest, lowest, and average temperature for a start date or a start and end date.
